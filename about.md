## About
![Joseph Lee](https://github.com/joseph-jnl/joseph-jnl.github.io/blob/master/images/Joe.jpg "Joseph Lee")

I received my PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Marquette University where I investigated brain activity of people being pulled off balance while walking. My dissertation involved differentiating brain activity from large, highly variable sources of noise using machine learning techniques and then applying these methods to compare healthy volunteers with those with spinal cord injury. I am currently a Data Science Fellow at Insight Data Science.
